    "aboutMe": "I'm a long time resident of central North Carolina - specifically Chapel Hill. I became interested in computer science when I was in middle school by building custom computers. I thought technology and computers were incredibly important considering how much I used them daily, so I thought I'd demystify the magic myself and learn how they work. As a freshman I ended up loving my first programming course at UNC, was recruited to be a TA, and went on to help teach intro courses for the next five semesters. With languages such as Java, Typescript, and Python, I've taught a wide range of topics such as Object-Oriented vs Functional Programming, ES6 and higher-order functions, the difference between reference and value types, and parsing scientific data for analysis. In addition, I assisted with research on multiple projects in the Computer Science Department for over two years as part of the Graphics and Virtual Reality Research Group. I'm currently working as a Software Engineer at Fidelity Investments on the NetBenefits Homepage team. I love any sort of programming from OOP to Functional, but enjoy web development the most. When I don't have VSCode pulled up I'm either out exercising, at home watching European Football, or playing with my two-year-old dog, Sudo.",
